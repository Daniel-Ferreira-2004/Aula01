                <p>The Last Czarnian and "The Main Man," Lobo is the most badass bounty hunter in the galaxy.

                    He’s the best bounty hunter in the known universe and the last sentient being you’d ever want to get
                    into a bar fight with if you hope to make it out in one piece. He’s the intergalactic alien badass
                    known as Lobo, often called by his nickname “The Main Man,” and if you’re lucky, you’ll never cross
                    his path.

                    You might be asking yourself why an alien being would be named after an Earth animal, even one as
                    fierce as a wolf. That’s because the word “Lobo” in this instance translates into “he who devours
                    your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it” in the ancient Khund dialect. Turns out, his parents could
                    not have given him a more fitting name.

                    Riding around the spaceways on his “space cycle,” which he named Spacehog, Lobo exhibits all the
                    traits someone would associate with a biker in a Hell’s Angels-style motorcycle gang on Earth, from
                    his long hair and tattoos, down to his kill or be killed attitude. There’s nothing in the galaxy
                    that Lobo loves more than his pet dolphins, a good fight, the ladies and getting drunk in some
                    intergalactic dive bar. Probably all in that order.

                    Over the years, Lobo has fought on the side of both the good guys and the bad, pretty much just
                    drifting towards whoever pays him the most to get the job done, or which side promises him the
                    better, bloodier fight. He’s tussled with Superman and the Justice League, and just about every
                    superhero in the DC Universe.

            <img src="img/lobo-origem_cke.webp" alt="Lobo">

            <p>His strength is extremely high, capable of rivaling powerful beings like Superman. For example, he has
                already rendered Superman unconscious without much apparent effort. Lobo has an extremely keen sense of
                tracking, which allows him to find any object or person he has come into contact with, even if they are
                on the other side of the universe. His only weakness is poisonous gases. Lobo also travels in a vacuum,
                without the need for oxygen, using a space motorcycle. His superhuman resistance is truly strange: he
                can be injured by bullets, knives, and whatever else comes his way, but he does not die.

                In Guy Gardner Reborn, Lobo demonstrates great resistance to fire, when several thunderers next to him
                were incinerated by a statue of Sinestro, but the Main Man suffered nothing other than singed hair.

                However, he cannot die under any circumstances. In the comic book “Lobo’s Back” (in Brazil, “Lobo Está
                Morto”), he is murdered and his soul is sent to Heaven. After several confusions and a lot of astral
                violence, neither Heaven nor Hell accept him, and his soul is returned to his body. After that, his soul
                always returns to his body, even if only a drop of blood remains, for example (his regenerative capacity
                takes care of forming a new body from the remaining piece).

                For most of his life, Lobo literally terrified his adversaries with his mere presence. His opponents
                avoided confrontation, under penalty of each drop of his blood becoming another Lobo. This ability was
                taken away by Vril Dox after a saga of L.E.G.I.O.N., where Lobo used his replication power to the
                maximum, becoming sterile. Some time later, it was discovered that one of Lobo’s clones had survived,
                and had become more intelligent than Lobo himself. In the confrontation, one of the Wolves won, but to
                this day it is not known whether it was the original or the clone. If the clone won, then Main Man could
                still have the power of replication. However, Main Man was later seen removing a mini-radio from his own
                brain; this concludes that the original Wolf won, since only organic matter can be reproduced.
